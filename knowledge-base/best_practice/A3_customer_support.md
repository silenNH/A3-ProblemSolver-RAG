# A3 Problem Solving - Improving Customer Support Response Time

## Background
Recent customer satisfaction surveys indicate that slow response times are a top complaint. With an expanding customer base, the support team has become overwhelmed by ticket volume, often responding outside the SLA of 8 hours. This issue is leading to account cancellations and negative reviews on public platforms.

## Current Condition
- Average ticket response time: 16 hours.
- 40% of tickets exceed SLA window.
- Triage and prioritization of incoming tickets is handled manually.

## Goal
Achieve SLA compliance of 90% for initial ticket responses within 1 month through workflow optimization and capacity adjustment.

## Root Cause Analysis
- Ticket triage is inconsistent and handled by rotating agents.
- No automated priority tagging.
- Insufficient staffing during peak hours and lack of escalation paths.

## Countermeasures
- Establish a dedicated triage team with defined responsibilities.
- Implement automated rules in the ticketing system to assign tags and priorities.
- Introduce shift rotations to ensure coverage during high-volume periods.

## Implementation Plan
- Week 1: Define triage team roles and provide training.
- Week 2: Reconfigure ticketing system to auto-tag and prioritize.
- Week 3: Realign schedules to cover peak times.

## Follow-Up
Weekly review of SLA compliance and customer feedback. Monthly audit of ticket backlog and escalation efficiency.
