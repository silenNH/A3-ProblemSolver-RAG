# A3 Problem Solving - Reducing Late Deliveries

## Background
Customer complaints about late deliveries have increased by 40% over the last quarter, directly impacting satisfaction ratings and resulting in the loss of several key accounts. Internal metrics show consistent underperformance in delivery KPIs. The late delivery issue affects both B2C and B2B clients, with especially high delays observed in orders requiring multi-stage fulfillment.

## Current Condition
- 25% of orders are delivered late, which is 5 times the company benchmark.
- Delays are prevalent in both order processing (data entry errors, slow confirmation) and shipping (missed dispatch windows, last-mile carrier delays).
- Internal audit shows inconsistent prioritization and insufficient communication between sales, warehouse, and shipping teams.

## Goal
Reduce late deliveries from 25% to under 5% in 3 months through process alignment and resource optimization.

## Root Cause Analysis
- No standardized order prioritization process.
- Staff shortages and lack of backup planning during peak periods.
- Poor visibility into order status and bottlenecks.

## Countermeasures
- Develop and implement a standardized prioritization matrix.
- Hire temporary staff and implement a flexible shift system during high-volume periods.
- Introduce a digital dashboard for real-time order tracking.

## Implementation Plan
- Week 1: Finalize prioritization process and begin staff training.
- Week 2: Implement scheduling changes and onboard temp staff.
- Week 3: Deploy order tracking dashboard.
- Ongoing: Monitor weekly metrics and adjust staffing as needed.

## Follow-Up
Review delivery performance bi-weekly and adjust processes based on feedback from operations and customer service teams.
