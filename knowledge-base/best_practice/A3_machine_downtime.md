# A3 Problem Solving - Reducing Machine Downtime

## Background
The main production line has experienced frequent unplanned stoppages, causing major delays in manufacturing output. Over the past two months, total downtime has increased by 35%, leading to missed order deadlines and higher overtime costs. Maintenance records show reactive maintenance is the norm, with no established preventive schedule.

## Current Condition
- Average daily downtime: 90 minutes.
- Downtime events occur 3+ times per day, mainly due to overheating and sensor failures.
- Current system lacks automated alerts and condition monitoring.

## Goal
Reduce machine downtime to less than 30 minutes per day within 2 months by implementing preventive practices and monitoring tools.

## Root Cause Analysis
- Absence of preventive maintenance schedule.
- Operators lack training to identify early warning signs.
- No digital infrastructure for early fault detection.

## Countermeasures
- Develop a detailed PM checklist and schedule.
- Install IoT-based sensors for temperature and vibration monitoring.
- Conduct operator training on basic troubleshooting.

## Implementation Plan
- Week 1: Develop PM checklist and assign technician responsibilities.
- Week 2: Install sensors and integrate alert system.
- Week 3: Train operators and start pilot testing.

## Follow-Up
Track downtime daily, conduct weekly team huddles to review root causes of each event, and update PM plan accordingly.
